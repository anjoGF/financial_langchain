        "# Medium LangChain Demo\n",
        "\n",
        "This repository contains the Jupyter notebook `Medium_LangChain_Demo.ipynb`, which is part of a Medium article series focusing on leveraging LangChain with SQL for enhanced financial data analysis. The notebook demonstrates the integration of LangChain with SQL databases, showing how to interact with SQL databases using natural language queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The `Medium_LangChain_Demo.ipynb` notebook is designed for AI architects and ML engineers interested in exploring the capabilities of LangChain in conjunction with SQL databases. It is particularly focused on financial data analysis, offering insights into how natural language processing (NLP) can be utilized to simplify data querying processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "\n",
        "- Integration of LangChain with SQL databases.\n",
        "- Usage of natural language queries to interact with SQL databases.\n",
        "- Demonstrations of advanced querying and data analysis in the financial sector.\n",
        "- Examples and explanations of various LangChain features and tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Getting Started\n",
        "\n",
